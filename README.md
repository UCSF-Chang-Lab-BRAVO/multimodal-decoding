Code for our paper: "A high-performance neuroprosthesis for speech decoding and avatar control" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06443-4)

To explore the code for each modality, check out the corresponding folder! 

### Text decoding
`text` folder -  train a model on the 1024-word-General sentence set and evaluate it on completely unseen sentences! 

### Synthesis
`synthesis` -  train a model using HuBERT units for speech synthesis from brain activity

### Avatar
`avatar`  - train a model on orofacial movements

Thank you for your interest in our work!
